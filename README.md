# Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) for Swift

> Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor to Secure Socket Layer 3.0 (SSL). SSL 3.0 was deprecated in June 2015.

A Swift wrapper for Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) using OpenSSL.

- [x] Swifty Interface
- [x] Client and Server
- [x] Tested

## Examples

The examples below assume you already have a socket library and you want to add TLS. If you do not already have a socket library, check out [Socks](https://github.com/czechboy0/Socks) by Honza Dvorsky. 

There is an add-on for Socks called [SecretSocks](https://github.com/czechboy0/SecretSocks) that includes this TLS library and provides a convenient `makeSecret()` method for all Socks' sockets.

If you are using a different socket library, no need to worry. You only need access to the socket's file descriptor to use this package.

```swift
import TLS

let socket: MyUnsecureSocket

// Create an unsecure socket
// and grab its file descriptor.
// ...

let descriptor: Int32 = socket.mySocketDescriptor
```

Now that you have the descriptor, let's add TLS.

### Client

This adds a Transport Security Layer for interacting with a server from a client. No certificates are required to be a client.

```swift
let secureSocket = try TLS.Socket(mode: .client, descriptor: descriptor)

try secureSocket.connect()
```

Here a context is created. You should hold on to this context if you intend to create multiple sockets. Your socket `descriptor` is then used with the `context` to create an `TLS.Socket`. 

The call to `connect()` creates the connection to the server to start sending and receiving data. This should be called **after** the unsecure socket has called its version of `connect()`.

### Server 

This adds a Transport Security Layer for interacting with a client from a server. Setting up a server requires certificates.

```swift
let context = try TLS.Context(mode: .server)

let secureSocket = try TLS.Socket(context: context, descriptor: descriptor, certificates: .files(
    certificateFile: "./Certs/cert.pem",
    privateKeyFile: "./Certs/key.pem",
    signature: .selfSigned
))

try secureSocket.accept()
```

Here a context is created. You should hold on to this context if you intend to create multiple sockets. Your socket `descriptor` is then used with the `context` to create an `TLS.Socket`. 

The call to `accept()` accepts the connection and performs the TLS handshake with the client. This should be called **after** the unsecure socket has called its version of `accept()`.

### Sending / Receiving

You can now send and receive data through the new secure socket.

```swift
try secureSocket.send([0x00, 0x01, 0x02])
let data = try secureSocket.receive(max: 3)
```

### Certificates

The `Certificates` enum lets you supply the appropriate certificates for your TLS-enabled server.

```swift
public enum Certificates {
    case none
    case files(certificateFile: String, privateKeyFile: String, signature: Certificate.Signature)
    case chain(chainFile: String, signature: Certificate.Signature)
}

public enum Certificate.Signature {
    case selfSigned
    case signedFile(caCertificateFile: String)
    case signedDirectory(caCertificateDirectory: String)
}
```

### Errors

The `Error` enum comprises all errors that can be thrown from this module. The `String` in all of the cases is a readable error message from LibreSSL.

## Using with Xcode

Swift Package Manager will automatically build this project correctly, but when using with Xcode, you will need to add a setting to your Xcode project file:

Under Project > Build Settings > Library Search Paths, add:

```
$(PROJECT_DIR)/**
```

## Vapor

This wrapper was created to power [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor), an Web Framework for Swift.
